# 🤖 Build Your Own GPT-2: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to a fun, educational journey of building GPT-2 from scratch! This project breaks down the "scary" AI concepts into simple, understandable pieces - like building with LEGOs!

## 🎯 What Are We Building?

Imagine having an AI friend who can:

- ✍️ Continue writing stories you start
- 🎵 Generate song lyrics
- 📝 Help with creative writing
- 🤔 Answer questions about topics it's learned

## 🎓 Learning Journey

### 1️⃣ The Building Blocks

```python
# Each word becomes numbers the AI can understand
"Hello world!" → [3748, 995, 0]
```

- **Tokenizer**: Turns text into numbers (and back!)
- **Attention**: Helps AI understand which words are related
- **Neural Network**: The AI's "brain" for processing information

### 2️⃣ How It Works

Think of it like this:

1. 📚 AI reads lots of text (like learning from books)
2. 🧩 Breaks text into small pieces (tokens)
3. 🔍 Learns patterns (like how words go together)
4. ✍️ Uses patterns to write new text

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Basic Python knowledge
- Curiosity about AI!

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this project
git clone https://github.com/AIMLRLab/gpt2.git

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the training
python gpt2.py
```

## 📊 Model Details

### Architecture (The AI's Brain)

```
Input → Embeddings → Transformer Blocks → Output
      ↑          ↑                    ↑
Words to    Position     12 layers of smart
numbers     info         pattern recognition
```

### Training Settings

- **Batch Size**: 16 (processes 16 text chunks at once)
- **Context Length**: 512 (can "remember" 512 tokens)
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 (how fast it learns)
- **Model Size**: 124M parameters (like 124M knobs to tune)

### What These Numbers Mean

- **Batch Size**: Like solving 16 math problems at once
- **Context Length**: How many words it reads at once (like your short-term memory)
- **Learning Rate**: How big steps it takes when learning (too big = stumble, too small = slow)
- **Model Size**: How many "brain cells" it has (more = smarter but slower)

## 💡 Example Usage

```python
from gpt2 import GPT2

# Create AI model
model = GPT2()

# Generate text
prompt = "Once upon a time"
generated_text = model.generate(prompt, max_length=100)
print(generated_text)
```

## �� Training Progress

Watch your model learn:

```
Epoch 1: Loss 10.987 → "random gibberish"
Epoch 100: Loss 3.456 → "readable text"
Epoch 1000: Loss 2.123 → "coherent stories"
```

## 🎮 Playground

Try these prompts:

1. "The future of AI is"
2. "Once upon a time"
3. "The secret to happiness"

## ⚠️ Limitations

Remember:

- Needs lots of training data
- Can make mistakes
- Learns patterns but doesn't truly "understand"
- Works best with topics it's trained on
